# fullstack-demo

I am using Selenium in the back-end because the scraper which i was using was getting blocked by LinkedIn i.e. Status Code 999.

I have made front-end in Just component, I know I can be divided into more smaller components for reusability.

To run the Backend, run api on server 8080,

For Front-End, Initally it is running on localhost 3000 (npm start).

Required: (Chrome Browser version 91, Java 11 and 15)
